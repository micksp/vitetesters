# Vue 3 + Vite + Vitest

This project serves as a playpen for vitest testing and vitest coverage reports

The project uses API calls that do not exist, so the frontend won't work visually. 
That's okay since this is not the aim of this project.

## Test
run tests with watch
```shell
npm run test
```
coverage
```shell
npm run test:coverage
```
